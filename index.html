                    <h2>Online Blog post for inspiration</h2>
                        <p>First, let me introduce myself. My name is Sergei Garcia, and I’m a full-time front end developer with 2 years experience. In that time, I’ve worked as a front-end developer for both a Forbes 500 consulting firm and a small company.
                                This may not sound like a lot of experience, but finishing my second year as a developer has been a huge milestone for me. This is because I had no real experience doing web development — and not much programming experience in general beyond some basic C# and Java training I got from a few online courses. I also didn’t have a computer science degree since I graduated with a degree in IT project management.</p>

                        <p>So this is <em>my</em> new venture. Diving into the world of web development. It's exciting and scary all at once.</p>
                        <p>It isn't that bad if you repeat what Dory said in finding Nemo. She said just keep swimming, just keep swimming. All I keep hearing about coding is <em>just keep coding, just keep coding</em> and the more you do it the more familiar it becomes. <a href="https://websitesetup.org/become-web-developer/">Read This</a></p>
